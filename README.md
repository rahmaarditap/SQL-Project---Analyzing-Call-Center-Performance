## Introduction
This project demonstrates the use of SQL to analyze and optimize call center performance. The dataset includes information about calls, agents, and customer rating. By leveraging advanced SQL queries, this analysis uncovers trends, identifies areas for improvement, and provides actionable insights to enhance overall efficiency and customer satisfaction.
**The insights derived from this analysis can guide managers in implementing data-driven to enhancing call center performance.**

## Dataset
The dataset includes 5000 call center records with the following attributes:
1. ``Call_ID``: Unique identifier for each call.
2. ``Agent``: Agent handling the call.
3. ``Date``: Date of the call.
4. ``Time``: Start time of the call.
5. ``Topic``: Call topic category.
6. ``Answered_status``: Whether the call was answered (Y/N).
7. ``Resolved_status``: Whether the issue was resolved (Y/N).
8. ``Speed_of_Answer_in_Seconds``: Time taken to answer in seconds.
9. ``Talk_Duration``: Average call duration.
10. ``Satisfaction_Rating``: Customer satisfaction rating (1-5).

## SQL Techniques Used
1. Common Table Expression (CTEs)
2. Window Functions
3. Subqueries
4. Join Tables
5. Date and Time Manipulation
6. Aggregate Functions

## Solution
### Q1. What is the average resolution time for each topic and how does it compare to the overall average resolution?
```sql
with resolution_by_topic as(
	select topic,
		round(avg(time_to_sec(Talk_Duration)), 2)  as avg_resolution_time
	from data_call_center
	where Resolved_Status = 'Y'
	group by topic),
overall_resolution as(
	select round(avg(time_to_sec(Talk_Duration)), 2) as overall_avg_resolution
	from data_call_center
	where Resolved_Status = 'Y')
select rt.topic,
	   rt.avg_resolution_time,
	   ovr.overall_avg_resolution,
	   abs(rt.avg_resolution_time - ovr.overall_avg_resolution) as resolution_diff_in_second,
	   case
		when rt.avg_resolution_time > ovr.overall_avg_resolution then 'Slower than Average'
		else 'Faster than Average'
	   end as resolution_comparison 
from resolution_by_topic rt, overall_resolution ovr;
```
topic            |avg_resolution_time|overall_avg_resolution|resolution_diff_in_second|resolution_comparison|
